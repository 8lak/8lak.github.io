About this site

## ðŸ“œ About Me
I'm Blake. I was born in La Ceiba, Honduras, and now live in Saint Paul, Minnesota. I enjoy analyzing data and discovering patterns. I use AI, data feature engineering, and machine learning to explore how data interacts with itself. I have a strong interest in the stock market and often experiment with different indicators to quantify their predictability in combination with others. Ultimately, I enjoy uncovering the underlying patterns in daily life and understanding how they affect us as individuals. I also enjoy running and reading as hobbies.
